Microservice Instrutions:
In order to request data, the user must start hosting the server on Localhost:3000. They then will select either the "Submit Entry" button (connected to REST API POST) or "Retrieve Records" button (connected to REST API GET) that will either post an entry to MongoDB or retreive all records. 
The data request or retrievel will follow in either confirminig the request that the data was stored, or retrieving the data already stored. Once added to the existing program, the user can safely know their submitted data is stored in an external location.
